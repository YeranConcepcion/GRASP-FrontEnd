    GRASP (Gas Refill Application for a Sustainable Puerto Rico) is a platform designed to provide Puerto Rican drivers with accurate, real-time gas price information to help 
    them save on fuel costs. Addressing the financial challenges faced by students and low-income residents, GRASP gathers and consolidates data from Puerto Rico’s Department of Consumer Affairs (DACO) 
    to provide transparent, user-friendly price comparisons of nearby gas stations. 
    Built with a serverless architecture for cost efficiency and scalability, the app offers an essential resource in emergencies by highlighting gas stations with available fuel. 
    GRASP is not only a tool for economic relief but also fosters transparency, promotes smarter spending, and supports market competition in Puerto Rico’s fuel industry.
